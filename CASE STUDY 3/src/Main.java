/*Create a system to calculate and classify Body Mass Index (BMI). The system should:
1.	Accept weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) from the user.
2.	Calculate the BMI using the formula:
    o	BMI Calculation: BMI = weight / (height * height)
3.	Classify the BMI into one of the following categories:
    o	Underweight: BMI < 18.5
    o	Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
    o	Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
    o	Obese: BMI ≥ 30
4.	Display the BMI value and its classification.
Define the class BMITracker with fields, an appropriate constructor, getter and setter methods, a toString method,
and business logic methods. Define the class BMITrackerUtil with methods acceptRecord, printRecord, and menuList.
Define the class Program with a main method to test the functionality of the utility class.
